Poetry's TOML lockfiles are very verbose and difficult to review quickly.
This friction complicates the responsible acceptance of pull requests that change dependencies.
`diff-poetry-lock` aims to solve this problem by posting a readable summary of all lockfile changes to pull requests.

## Example

<img width="916" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1723176/224580589-bd5e7a5f-e39f-40d3-91a2-b4bd02284100.png">

## Usage

### [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) action

Simply add the following step to your Github Action:

```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Diff poetry.lock
        uses: target/diff-poetry-lock@30a153ca2d5cbdd209fc78b0ec013915748b6bab # v0.0.2
```

When the diff changes during the lifetime of a pull request,
the original comment will be updated.
If all changes are rolled back, the comment will be deleted.

### [Vela CI](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/usage/plugins) plugin

```yaml
stages:
  renovate-validate:
    steps:
      - name: Validate SCA configuration
        image: ghcr.io/target/diff-poetry-lock:v0.0.3
        ruleset:
          event: [pull_request]
          path: ["poetry.lock"]
          continue: true
```

### Debug logging

Set the `DEBUG_MODE` environment variable to `true` (or `1`, `yes`, `on`) to enable verbose debug logging.
When unset, only informational and higher level log messages are emitted, reducing noise in CI logs.
